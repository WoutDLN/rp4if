#3. Prepare a USB for your students

This USB should contain:a folder for each RPi, with the RPi's name. Each folder should in turn contain:

1. two high-resolution `.png` images of the documents the students will be sharing and re-using
    
2. a random, relatively small `.jpg` image that has something to do with those documents, for the students to develop a small HTML page around

#7. Teach your students about HTML and CSS.

##Credits and Copyright

This tutorial was developed by Wout Dillen and Joshua Schäuble, as part of the [IIIF](https://iiif.io) courses of the [University of Antwerp](https://www.uantwerpen.be/)'s Summer School on [Digital Humanities: Processing and Analysing Images](https://www.uantwerpen.be/en/summer-schools/digital-humanities--/) (3-7 September 2018, Antwerp BE). In this course, students used an earlier version of this tutorial to set up a IIIF-compatible image server ([iipimage](http://iipimage.sourceforge.net)) on a local network of [Raspberry Pi](https://www.raspberrypi.org) computers, to ultimately re-use and manipulate each other's images using the IIIF protocol. 

The summer school was generously sponsored by the University of Antwerp's [Literature Department](https://www.uantwerpen.be/en/faculties/faculty-of-arts/research-and-valoris/departments/department-of-literature/), the [Antwerp Summer University](https://www.uantwerpen.be/en/education/international/international-students/antwerp-summer-university/), the Flemish Government's [Department of Economy, Science, and Innovation](https://www.ewi-vlaanderen.be), [Digital Humanities Flanders](http://uahost.uantwerpen.be/platformdh/index.php/dhu-f/) (DHu.F), and [DARIAH-BE](http://be.dariah.eu) – the last of which provided us with the course's hardware and the opportunity to develop these tutorials further.
