## 1. Accessing Images in the Browser

Now that we have set up IIPImage, you can access all of the images in your `var/www/iipimage-server` directory in **any browser or IIIF-compliant image viewer** – such as [Mirador](http://projectmirador.org), [Universal Viewer](http://universalviewer.io), [OpenSeadragon](https://openseadragon.github.io/examples/tilesource-iiif/), or [Leaflet-IIIF](https://github.com/mejackreed/Leaflet-IIIF).

When you call an image via an IIPImage server `URL`, the image server will show you this image according to some **parameters** that you have set in the `URL`. **Let's have a look at how this works.**

Open your browser (on the laptop!) and go to:

```bash
your.ip.address/iipsrv/iipsrv.fcgi?IIIF=image1.tif/full/400,/0/default.jpg
```
 
Now, open another tab in your browser and go to:

```bash
your.ip.address/iipsrv/iipsrv.fcgi?IIIF=image1.tif/full/800,/90/grey.jpg
```

Both `URL`s show you the same image, but not in the same way.

.question[**Question:** compare the `URL`s above and try to find out how it influenced the server's presentation of that image in your browser.]

---

## 2. Experiment with the IIIF Image API


The IIIF consortium provides a detailed [**documentation** of the **IIIF Image API**'s parameters here](http://iiif.io/api/image/2.0/). Have a look at this documentation, and play with different settings for your images by manipulating the `URL` in the following exercise:

.exercise[
**Exercise:** Reading up on the IIIF parameters, find out how to:

- Rotate your image by `180` degrees
- Retrieve **only a section** of an image
- Retrieve an image with a width of `5000px` and a proportionally scaled height
- Retrieve an image with a `width` of `100px` and a `height` of `300px`
- Display your image in `greyscale`
]

.question[Once you have successfully completed these tasks, experiment some more with other parameters. Some of these parameters may produce an error. **Can you guess why?**]

## 3. Get the `info.json` from your image server

.warning[**JOSH:** 

what do the students need this for? Do we provide a Dries-like intermezzo between [Step 7](step7.html) and [Step 8](step8.html) ??

**To Do:** 

adapt slide accordingly.]

Dries showed us this morning, that all the information that you need to build tools that show your images work on the basis of a `info.json` file, which is generated by the server for every image.

enter the following `URL` into your browser:

```bash
your.ip.address/iipsrv/iipsrv.fcgi?IIIF=image1.tif
```

When no further IIIF URL variables are specified, the IIPImage server will forward you to the `info.json` file.

##Credits and Copyright

This tutorial was developed by Wout Dillen and Joshua Schäuble at the [Centre for Manuscript Genetics](https://www.uantwerpen.be/en/research-groups/centre-for-manuscript-genetics/) (CMG), as part of the [IIIF](https://iiif.io) courses of the [University of Antwerp](https://www.uantwerpen.be/)'s Summer School on [Digital Humanities](https://www.uantwerpen.be/en/summer-schools/digital-humanities--/). This is a one-week summer school organized by the [Antwerp Centre for Digital humanities and literary Criticism](https://www.uantwerpen.be/en/research-groups/digitalhumanities/) (ACDC). 

The course was first taught in Antwerp in 2018 (3-7 September), and an adapted version was taught again in 2019 (1-5 July). In the course, students learn how to set up a IIIF-compatible image server ([iipimage](http://iipimage.sourceforge.net)) on a local network of [Raspberry Pi](https://www.raspberrypi.org) computers, to ultimately re-use and manipulate each other's images using the IIIF protocol. 

The summer school's first edition was generously sponsored by the University of Antwerp's [Literature Department](https://www.uantwerpen.be/en/faculties/faculty-of-arts/research-and-valoris/departments/department-of-literature/), the [Antwerp Summer University](https://www.uantwerpen.be/en/education/international/international-students/antwerp-summer-university/), the Flemish Government's [Department of Economy, Science, and Innovation](https://www.ewi-vlaanderen.be), [Digital Humanities Flanders](http://uahost.uantwerpen.be/platformdh/index.php/dhu-f/) (DHu.F), and [DARIAH-BE](http://be.dariah.eu) – the last of which provided us with the course's hardware and the opportunity to develop these tutorials further.
