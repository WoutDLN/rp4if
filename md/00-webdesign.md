This tutorial was developed by Wout Dillen and Joshua Schäuble at the [Centre for Manuscript Genetics](https://www.uantwerpen.be/en/research-groups/centre-for-manuscript-genetics/) (CMG), as part of the [IIIF](https://iiif.io) courses of the [University of Antwerp](https://www.uantwerpen.be/)'s Summer School on [Digital Humanities](https://www.uantwerpen.be/en/summer-schools/digital-humanities--/). This is a one-week summer school organized by the [Antwerp Centre for Digital humanities and literary Criticism](https://www.uantwerpen.be/en/research-groups/digitalhumanities/) (ACDC). 

The course was first taught in Antwerp in 2018 (3-7 September), and an adapted version was taught again in 2019 (1-5 July). In the course, students learn how to set up a IIIF-compatible image server ([iipimage](http://iipimage.sourceforge.net)) on a local network of [Raspberry Pi](https://www.raspberrypi.org) computers, to ultimately re-use and manipulate each other's images using the IIIF protocol. 

The summer school's first edition was generously sponsored by the University of Antwerp's [Literature Department](https://www.uantwerpen.be/en/faculties/faculty-of-arts/research-and-valoris/departments/department-of-literature/), the [Antwerp Summer University](https://www.uantwerpen.be/en/education/international/international-students/antwerp-summer-university/), the Flemish Government's [Department of Economy, Science, and Innovation](https://www.ewi-vlaanderen.be), [Digital Humanities Flanders](http://uahost.uantwerpen.be/platformdh/index.php/dhu-f/) (DHu.F), and [DARIAH-BE](http://be.dariah.eu) – the last of which provided us with the course's hardware and the opportunity to develop these tutorials further.
