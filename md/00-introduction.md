## An Introduction to the Course

In this course, we will be setting up a **local IIIF compatible RPi server farm**. 

That is quite a mouthful, let's break that down into smaller bits.

## An Introduction to the Course

In this course, we will be setting up a local IIIF compatible .red[**RPi**] server farm. 

### 1. Raspberry Pi

.flexbox-ltr[
.boxitem[
The Raspberry Pi is a low cost, credit-card sized computer that plugs into a computer monitor or TV, and uses a standard keyboard and mouse. It is a capable little device that enables people of all ages to explore computing, and to learn how to program in languages like Scratch and Python. It’s capable of doing everything you’d expect a desktop computer to do, from browsing the internet and playing high-definition video, to making spreadsheets, word-processing, and playing games.

### 2. Server Farm

.flexbox-ltr[
.boxitem[
A server farm or server cluster is a collection of computer servers – usually maintained by an organization to supply server functionality far beyond the capability of a single machine. Server farms often consist of thousands of computers which require a large amount of power to run and to keep cool. At the optimum performance level, a server farm has enormous costs (both financial and environmental) associated with it.]

### 3. RPi Server Farm

.flexbox-ltr[
.boxitem[
Our Raspberry Pi server farm will work much in the same way: we will connect a bunch of computers (the RPis), and install servers on them that will allow them to communicate with each other. Built on mini-computers, our server farm will obviously have much less computing power than a regular server farm, but this also comes at a much lower cost (also both financial and environmental).]

### 4. IIIF

.flexbox-ltr[
.boxitem[
The International Image Interoperability Framework (IIIF) provides a standardised method of describing and delivering images over the web, as well as "presentation based metadata (that is, structural metadata) about structured sequences of images. If institutions holding artworks, books, newspapers, manuscripts, maps, scrolls, single sheet collections, and archival materials provide IIIF endpoints for their content, any IIIF-compliant viewer or application can reuse and display both the images and their structural and presentation metadata.

##Credits and Copyright

This tutorial was developed by Wout Dillen and Joshua Schäuble at the [Centre for Manuscript Genetics](https://www.uantwerpen.be/en/research-groups/centre-for-manuscript-genetics/) (CMG), as part of the [IIIF](https://iiif.io) courses of the [University of Antwerp](https://www.uantwerpen.be/)'s Summer School on [Digital Humanities](https://www.uantwerpen.be/en/summer-schools/digital-humanities--/). This is a one-week summer school organized by the [Antwerp Centre for Digital humanities and literary Criticism](https://www.uantwerpen.be/en/research-groups/digitalhumanities/) (ACDC). 

The course was first taught in Antwerp in 2018 (3-7 September), and an adapted version was taught again in 2019 (1-5 July). In the course, students learn how to set up a IIIF-compatible image server ([iipimage](http://iipimage.sourceforge.net)) on a local network of [Raspberry Pi](https://www.raspberrypi.org) computers, to ultimately re-use and manipulate each other's images using the IIIF protocol. 

The summer school's first edition was generously sponsored by the University of Antwerp's [Literature Department](https://www.uantwerpen.be/en/faculties/faculty-of-arts/research-and-valoris/departments/department-of-literature/), the [Antwerp Summer University](https://www.uantwerpen.be/en/education/international/international-students/antwerp-summer-university/), the Flemish Government's [Department of Economy, Science, and Innovation](https://www.ewi-vlaanderen.be), [Digital Humanities Flanders](http://uahost.uantwerpen.be/platformdh/index.php/dhu-f/) (DHu.F), and [DARIAH-BE](http://be.dariah.eu) – the last of which provided us with the course's hardware and the opportunity to develop these tutorials further.
